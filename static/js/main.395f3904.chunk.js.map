               I started with CodeNation in November 2019, the first course I attended was the Develop Cyber 3 week course.\n                    During my time on the cyber course I learnt some interesting things, from the different types of hackers to\n                    how to pick a lock. There was a lot of variety on the course and the tutor was great, I met some interesting\n                    people and enjoyed my time on the course.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"cyberSecurity\">\n\n                <h3>Realisation</h3>\n                \n                <p>\n                    One thing I realised when I was on the cyber course is that it was not actually for me, but how did I come\n                    to this conclusion. Well during my time in the Manchester CodeNation HQ I was sitting in the communal area\n                    eating my lunch, that is when I noticed the big screen and all this pretty looking code, it made me curious,\n                    I had to know what is was about so I decided to speak to a member of staff who told me it was code that the\n                    Master Coding class was doing, so I asked how I can get on the coding course and they told me about the 3\n                    week Develop Coding course they had starting in January after the Christmas break, so I signed up for it nad\n                    I am glad I did.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"developCoding\">\n\n                        <h3>Develop Coding Week 1 Day 1</h3>\n                <p>\n                    When I started the Develop Coading course on the 7th of January, I just knew that this is what I wanted, now\n                    I needed to find a way of taking this short course and making something biogger out of it. On day 4 of the\n                    course there was a job advertised on the slack channel and decided I would give it a shot, even though I\n                    knew I didn't have the skills or experience to do the job I had nothing to lose, so I went for it.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"firstWeekDev\">   \n\n                    <h3>Week 1 Day 5</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Day 5 9am and my phone starts ringing, it's one of the engagement team, she told me that the job I had put\n                    my name for was a bit to far away but would I be interedted in another position, I didn't know what to say\n                    so I just said yes and went for it. I didn't know what to expect or anything.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"meetingThea\">\n\n                    <h3>Week 2</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Monday week 2 I had to leave the course at lunch time because it was being held at Trafford College in\n                    Timperley and I needed to be at CodeNation in Manchester City Centre for an Interview Prep, this was to help\n                    me when I got to the recruitment session which was suposed to be on the Wednesday, but when I arrived at\n                    CodeNation on Monday I was asked if I wanted to attend a secon recruitment day, obviously I said yes why\n                    wouldn't I, the more opportunities the better. The first 2 recruitment sessions I attended I left feeling\n                    very proud, I may not have been offered and interview or a job but I gained some good experience and got\n                    some positive feedback from the recruiters.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"theLastWeek\">\n\n                    <h3>Week 3</h3>\n                <p> \n                    Jump to week 3 now and I had one more recruitment session to attend before the course finished, but it\n                    turned out I didn't get that one either, I was feeling a little sad but not dissapointed and still very\n                    enthusiastic as I knew I would be inivted to more in the future, there was still a chance and I knew I had\n                    to keep going, except before I left that 3rd and what I thought was the final recruitment session I would\n                    attend for a while I was approached by another member of the engagement team asking me if I wanted to attend\n                    another one the following day, now I was all excited again.\n                    <br></br>\n                    I went home and researched the company and was really interested to know more bout them. The next morning I\n                    got up and went to CodeNation Manchester to meet the CEO and Director of this company. Little did I know\n                    these guys were about to become my new employers.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"howItWent\">\n                \n                    <h3>So heres how it went</h3>\n                <p>\n                    I walked in as I do, I got my self a seat and waited patiently for the recruiters to arrive. When they\n                    arrived they were very friendly said good morning to us all and sat down on th chairs they were provided\n                    with to sit on in front of the group of people hoping to bag them selves a job (like all sessions haha).\n                    From the moment they sat down there was a lot of eye contact, I had a good feeling about this one, I just\n                    knew it was for me so I had to give it my all. The session got started the guys started telling us about\n                    their company, about them and how it all started, now I was even more interested.\n                    <br></br>\n                    Here come the stand ups, the part thst makes me nervous and probably many others that have ever done this\n                    type of thing, I had to stand up in front of the recruiters and the other students wanting this position and\n                    talk about my self for 2 minutes, now that doesn't seem long right? wrong it feels like a long long time and\n                    you have a million and one things going through your head, am I good enough, am I rambling, are they even\n                    listening, but guess what I did none of that what I was thinking and they maintained eye contact and really\n                    listened to what I was saying, now I had a really good feeling. Next come the group challenge, we had to\n                    create an app that would link with another device/system and give back some diagnostics, data et... I didn't\n                    feel like I did particularly well on this part but I was so wrong.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <div  className=\"interview\">\n\n                    <h3>I got an Interview</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    I was invited to an interview the next day at the recruiters premises, I was so happy I didn't stop smiling\n                    for the rest of the day. The next day which was Friday 24th January I travelled to the employers premises\n                    and had my interview (and lunch they were very kind and welcoming), after I had my interview I went home and\n                    waited for the all important email, did I get the job or didn't I, only time would tell. 4:30pm and I\n                    received an email big letter CONGRATULATIONS, I did it I got the job, I was so happy it felt like it was the\n                    best day of my life.\n                    <br></br>\n                    I had the weekend off and started Monday 27th January on the Master Coding Course, this was the first day of\n                    the rest of my life, my new career, my dreams had come true I was now in my dream career and it can only get\n                    better from here.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport Navbar from './Navbar'\n\nexport default function AboutMe() {\n    return (\n\n        <div className=\"aboutMeContainer\">\n            <Navbar/>\n            <div className=\"aboutMeTitle\">\n                <h1>About Me</h1>\n            </div>\n\n                <div>\n                    <h3 className=\"doingTitle\">What I am doing whilst making this portfolio</h3>\n\n                    <p className=\"masterCoding\">\n                        I am currently on a Master Coding Course with Code Nation, getting on this course was like a dream come\n                        true, but what made it even better is that I got it on an apprentiship.\n                        <br></br>\n                        Since I was young I have had an interest in technology and computers, but didn't what it was that I wanted\n                        to know at the time.\n                        <br></br>\n                        As I got older and started working, I did lots of jobs but none of them was my dream job.

It was a web design and development course, but I soon discovered that the course content was\n                        not what I was looking for and wanted something more in depth and techy.\n                        <br></br>\n                        This is when I started to look at other options but was struggling to find something that suited what I\n                        wanted. I ended up having a chat with my brother who pointed me in the direction of Code Nation, I ended up\n                        on their website looking at what they had to offer and downloaded a brochure, but life got in the way and I\n                        left it at that and carried on working to pay the bills.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                        <h3 className=\"dayoffTitle\">My Day Off</h3>\n                    <p className=\"dayoff\">\n                        One day after a week of long shifts I finally had a day off, I was just relaxing when my phone started to\n                        ring and it was one of the lovely guys from Code Nation, they told me all about the course they had to offer\n                        and the different options that were open to me.\n                        <br></br>\n                        I ended up going into the Manchester Code Nation office and decided to do the Develop Cyber course, I\n                        thought that is what I wanted, but during the time of the course and my time in the building I was watching\n                        other students do the Coding course and that is when I knew that is what I wanted to do I wanted to work\n                        with code. I ended up having a chat with a member of staff who helped me to sign up for the next Develop\n                        Coding course they had.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                        <h3 className=\"quickBriefTitle\">A quick brief how I got here</h3>\n                    <p className=\"quickBrief\">\n                        During my first week on the 3 week Develop Coding course, there was an apprentiship advertised on slack. At\n                        that time I didn't know if I was ready for that but I decided to throw my self in at the deep end and go for\n                        it any way.\n                        <br></br>\n                        The day after I put my name forward I received a call from one of the engagement team, telling me that the\n                        job I put my name forward for was too far to travel but there were other opportunities available, so I put\n                        my name forward and this is where my tech journey really started.\n                        <br></br>\n                        I went to 3 recruitment sessions between week 2 and week 3 of the Develop Course, which ment I was missing\n                        out on learning with my group, but that was ok because getting an apprentiship was more important to me\n                        because I knew the master course would teach me far more than the develop course could. My 4th and last\n                        recruitment session was where my career began, I was offered a job my dreams started to become reality and\n                        it felt amazing.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                    \n                        <h3 className=\"hereIamTitle\">Here I am now</h3>\n                    <p className=\"hereIamnow\">\n                        And now here I am on the Master Coding course and yes I have ups and downs, but I work through them with \n                        the help of the amazing guys at codenation and so I am loving every minute of it.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport me from '../img/me.jpeg'\n// import { Route } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Navbar from './Navbar'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n    return (\n\n        <div className=\"homeContainer\">\n            <Navbar />\n            <div className=\"homeTitle\">\n                <h1>Kirsty Purkhardt Portfolio</h1>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"topContainer\">\n            \n                <div clasName=\"imgMe\">\n                    <img src={me} alt=\"pic of me\"/>\n                </div>\n\n                <div className=\"lists\">\n                    \n                    <div className=\"learnt\">\n                        <h3 className=\"underlineThingsList\">Things I have Learnt :</h3>\n\n                        <ul className=\"learntList\">\n                            <li>Java Script</li>\n                            <li>HTML</li>\n                            <li>Css</li>\n                            <li>React</li>\n                            <li>React Dom</li>\n                            <li>React Router Dom</li>\n                            <li>Flexbox</li>\n                            <li>Django Girls</li>\n                            <li>And more</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </div>\n                \n                    <div className=\"projects\">\n                        <h3 className=\"underlineProjectsList\">Projects Done</h3>\n                        <ol className=\"projectsList\">\n                            <li>Zen Garden</li>\n                            <li>Cyber Pet</li>\n                            <li>Car Park</li>\n                            <li>Dice game 1 player</li>\n                            <li>React page Replicas</li>\n                            <li>Twitter Clone (group project)</li>\n\n                        </ol>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"joinContainer\">\n        \n                <h3 className=\"underlineWhy\">Why I joined CodeNation</h3>\n                <p>\n                    I joined CodeNation to gain the skills I need to become a Software Developer, but that is not the only\n                    reason.

just because I wanted to understand so badly and get the work done, it is not worth the stress, the work will still be there after a little break so take 5 and breathe.\n                </p>\n
